	<h1>Locter Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 13, 2025</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Locter (the "App"), developed by the project owner, collects, uses, stores, and
		shares information from users. Locter is designed to keep your location data on your device and give you full
		control over exports and backups.</p>

	<h2>1. Data we collect</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location data:</strong> Locter collects your device's location (GPS coordinates, timestamp, accuracy,
			altitude, speed, course) to detect where you have been and to generate visits and tracks. Location data is
			collected when you grant location permissions (When In Use or Always). The App uses background location features
			to track visits and locations when permitted. See the App's Info.plist keys:
			<code>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</code> and <code>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</code>.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Visit metadata:</strong> The App records detected visits (arrival/departure timestamps, coordinates,
			horizontal accuracy) and may perform reverse geocoding to obtain a human-readable place name or address for
			notifications and display.</li>

		<li><strong>Local device files:</strong> Locter stores all collected location and visit data in a local database
			located in the App Group container (<code>group.me.linjun.Locter</code>). The database filename used by the app is
			<code>db.locterdb</code>.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Photos (optional):</strong> If you grant Photo Library access, the App can match locations to your
			photos to aid organization. Photo access is only used for local matching and not uploaded to external servers.
		</li>

		<li><strong>iCloud backups (optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud/Backups on your device, Locter can create
			backups of your local database in your iCloud ubiquity container (<code>iCloud.me.linjun.Locter.backup</code>).
			Backups are stored in your iCloud account and are managed by iCloud; Locter does not transmit data to any external
			server besides your iCloud account.</li>

		<li><strong>GPX exports:</strong> You can export selected track data as GPX files. Exported GPX files are generated
			locally and saved/shared according to iOS share sheet behavior. The App does not automatically upload GPX files to
			developer-run servers.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2. How we use the data</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Provide core functionality:</strong> Location and visit data are used to detect places you've been,
			display them in the app, and create timelines and maps.</li>
		<li><strong>Notifications:</strong> The App may reverse-geocode visit locations to prepare user notifications about
			places you visit.</li>
		<li><strong>Exports & backups:</strong> When you choose to export or back up your data (manual or automatic iCloud
			backups), the App creates files (GPX or database backups) and either hands them to the iOS share sheet or writes
			them to your iCloud container.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. Data sharing and third parties</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No developer servers:</strong> Locter does not send your location, visit, photo data, or backups to any
			developer-controlled servers. There is no analytics or remote telemetry that collects personal data by default.
		</li>
		<li><strong>iCloud:</strong> Backups written to iCloud are stored under your iCloud account and are subject to
			Apple's iCloud Terms and privacy. Locter only writes the database files to the iCloud ubiquity container when
			iCloud is available and enabled on your device.</li>
		<li><strong>System frameworks:</strong> Locter uses Apple frameworks (CoreLocation, CoreLocation Visit monitoring,
			CLGeocoder) which may communicate with system services as part of their operation. For example, reverse geocoding
			requests go through Apple's geocoding services. This is part of standard iOS functionality.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>4. Data retention and deletion</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Local retention:</strong> All location and visit data is stored locally in the app's database
			(<code>db.locterdb</code>) inside the App Group container. Data remains on the device until you delete it from
			within the App or uninstall the App.</li>
		<li><strong>Delete data:</strong> You can remove individual visits or locations from within the App's UI. To fully
			delete all stored data, use the App's provided delete/clear data option (if available) or uninstall the App and
			delete any iCloud backup files created by Locter.</li>
		<li><strong>iCloud backups:</strong> Backups in iCloud remain until you delete them via the App's UI (if the App
			exposes deletion) or via iCloud Drive management in iOS Settings / Files.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>5. Your choices and controls</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location permissions:</strong> You control location access in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security
			&gt; Location Services &gt; Locter. You may choose "Never", "Ask Next Time", "While Using the App", or "Always".
			The App recommends "Always" for the most accurate background tracking but will still work with limited
			functionality if set to "While Using the App".</li>
		<li><strong>Photo Library permissions:</strong> You can revoke Photo access in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security
			&gt; Photos &gt; Locter.</li>
		<li><strong>Backups and exports:</strong> Automatic iCloud backups are optional and occur only if iCloud is enabled
			on your device. You can disable iCloud Drive or delete backup files from iCloud using iOS Files or Settings.</li>
		<li><strong>Exporting data:</strong> Use the App's export (GPX) feature to create shareable track files. The App
			will present the standard iOS share sheet so you decide where to send or save exported files.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>6. Security</h2>
	<p><strong>On-device storage:</strong> Collected data is kept on your device and in your iCloud account if you opt
		into backups. When stored locally, the database file is stored in the App Group container. The App does not
		implement server-side storage or remote endpoints.</p>
	<p><strong>Transmission:</strong> When you share or export data using the iOS share sheet or write backups to iCloud,
		the transmission security is handled by Apple's platform and the receiving service you choose (for example, AirDrop,
		Files, or third-party apps).</p>

	<h2>7. Children</h2>
	<p><strong>App Store age rating:</strong> 4+. The App is appropriate for users aged 4 and older according to App Store
		guidelines.</p>
	<p>We do not knowingly target or collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

	<h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We may update this policy to reflect changes to the App. When we do, the "Last updated" date at the top will be
		changed. Significant changes will be posted in the repository's README or release notes.</p>

	<h2>9. Contact</h2>
	<p>For questions about this privacy policy, please contact the app owner at <a
			href="mailto:locter+support@omit.pro">locter+support@omit.pro</a>.</p>

	<h2>Appendix â€” Technical notes (for app reviewers and technical users)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Location APIs used:</strong> CoreLocation (<code>startUpdatingLocation</code>,
			<code>startMonitoringVisits</code>, <code>startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges</code>, region monitoring).
			The App requests both WhenInUse and Always location authorizations.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Storage:</strong> GRDB-backed SQLite database stored as <code>db.locterdb</code> inside the App Group
			container <code>group.me.linjun.Locter</code>.</li>
		<li><strong>iCloud backup container:</strong> <code>iCloud.me.linjun.Locter.backup</code>. Automatic backups name
			files under <code>auto-backup</code> and may rotate up to a configured number of backups.</li>
		<li><strong>Photo usage:</strong> Photo access is used to auto-match photos to recorded locations locally; no photo
			data is uploaded elsewhere by the App.</li>
	</ul>
