  <h1>Horika Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-10-13</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Horika (the "App") by the developer (me.linjun.Holka) collects, uses, stores,
    and shares information when you install and use the App. The App is a camera application that provides
    film-simulation photo capture and editing features.</p>

  <p>If you need to contact us about privacy, please email: <a
      href="mailto:horika+support@omit.pro">horika+support@omit.pro</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. Data and device features the App uses</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> The App uses the device camera to capture photos. Permission prompt text (as shown in
      the app) — "We use the camera to take photos with film simulation effects." The App requests camera access via the
      standard iOS permission flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> The App saves photos to the user's photo library and may read the library to
      load albums when the user grants permission. Permission prompt text — "We need access to your photo library for
      saving photos." The App supports limited photo library access and gracefully falls back to saving directly to the
      camera roll when a custom album cannot be created.</li>
    <li><strong>NFC:</strong> The App can read NFC NDEF tags for an in-app "Horika Card" feature. Permission prompt text
      — "We use NFC to read data from the Horika Card" The App only reads tag payloads and exposes the read string to
      the app UI; it does not transmit the NFC payload anywhere by default.</li>
    <li><strong>In-App Purchases (IAP):</strong> The App uses StoreKit to offer a Pro/paid upgrade. Purchase
      transactions are handled by StoreKit; a local flag (stored in UserDefaults, optionally inside an app group)
      records the purchase state to unlock features.</li>
    <li><strong>Local storage &amp; diagnostics:</strong> The App stores local state and preferences (for example:
      statistics about photos/rolls used, UI settings, purchase flags) using local persistence like UserDefaults and
      app-local files. The App uses the unified system logger (os.log) for debug and error logging. Logs are stored
      locally on the device and are not sent to third-party analytics services by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio:</strong> The App configures an audio session to play shutter and UI sounds; the App does not
      record audio from the microphone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What the App collects</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos you take:</strong> When you capture photos using the App, the resulting image file (HEIC) is
      written to the photo library. The App may add metadata to saved images (for example: Software/App name, Make/Model
      fields, a "UserComment" value and IPTC keywords that contain film name and frame number where applicable). This
      metadata is embedded in the image file saved to your library.</li>
    <li><strong>NFC tag payloads:</strong> When you scan an NFC tag with the App's Horika Card feature, the App reads
      the tag payload (text) and makes it available within the app. The payload is not shared externally by the App
      unless you explicitly export or share it.</li>
    <li><strong>Local analytics-like statistics:</strong> The App keeps local counters and timestamps (photos taken,
      rolls used, tracking start date, last updated times) to show usage statistics inside the app. These are stored
      locally on the device.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase state:</strong> The App stores the fact that a user has unlocked the Pro features in
      UserDefaults or the app group storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How the App uses and shares data</h2>

  <p>The App uses camera and photo library access strictly to provide core app features: capture, process, and save
    photos. Image metadata is added to saved images to record the film and (optionally) frame number for your
    convenience and to preserve the analogue-style metadata.</p>

  <p>The App does not share your photos, NFC data, or local usage statistics with third-party analytics services by
    default. There are no network analytics SDKs detected in the codebase (for example Firebase, Sentry, Mixpanel,
    etc.).</p>

  <p>The App uses StoreKit to process payments. Transaction verification is performed using StoreKit APIs. Purchase
    flags are stored locally and not shared externally.</p>

  <p>If you choose to share a photo using the system share sheet or other sharing features, the data you share may be
    transferred to other apps or services. That sharing is initiated by you and is outside the App's control.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>

  <p>The codebase does not include third-party analytics or tracking SDKs. The App uses Apple's system frameworks
    (AVFoundation, Photos, CoreNFC, StoreKit, CoreImage, etc.). Any communications with Apple's servers (for StoreKit
    transactions or photo library syncing via iCloud) are governed by Apple's privacy and terms.</p>

  <h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>

  <p>Photos and their metadata are saved to your device's photo library. To delete those photos, remove them from the
    Photos app - they are not automatically deleted by uninstalling Horika.</p>

  <p>Local app data (preferences, statistics, purchase flags) are stored on-device. Deleting the App will remove most
    app-local data. Purchase records are maintained by App Store / StoreKit; if you reinstall, StoreKit restores
    purchases when appropriate.</p>

  <h2>6. Your privacy rights (GDPR / CCPA style guidance)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Because Horika does not create user accounts or centralize personal data on servers,
      most user data is stored locally on your device. You can access photos via the Photos app and app-local settings
      via the app UI.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete photos from the Photos app to remove images saved by Horika. To clear
      app-local settings and statistics, delete the app from your device. If you require assistance removing on-device
      data, contact <a href="mailto:horika+support@omit.pro">horika+support@omit.pro</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Data export:</strong> Photos are available via the Photos app and can be exported or shared using the
      system share sheet.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>

  <p>The App stores data locally on your device. Sensitive services like payments are handled by StoreKit and
    Apple-managed systems. The App does not transmit photos or NFC payloads to external servers by default.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>

  <p><strong>App Store age rating:</strong> 4+. The App is appropriate for users aged 4 and older according to App Store guidelines.</p>
  <p>We do not knowingly target or collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our app or applicable law. The "Last updated" date at the top
    indicates when this document was last revised.</p>

  <h2>10. App permissions &amp; usage strings (from InfoPlist)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Camera: "We use the camera to take photos with film simulation effects."</li>
    <li>Photo Library: "We need access to your photo library for saving photos."</li>
    <li>NFC: "We use NFC to read data from the Horika Card"</li>
  </ul>
