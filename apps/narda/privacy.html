	<h1>Narda Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-10-17</p>

	<p>Narda is a client-side camera app focused on playful, half-frame photography. This Privacy Policy explains
		how Narda collects and uses device features and local data when you use the App.</p>

	<h2>1. Data and device features the App uses</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Camera:</strong> The App uses the device camera to capture photos. The App requests camera access
			via the platform's standard permission flow.</li>
		<li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> The App saves photos to your photo library. When possible the App creates a
			dedicated album named <em>Narda</em> in the user's Photos library and writes captured images there. The App
			may read the library to show recent photos when the user grants permission.</li>
		<li><strong>Local storage &amp; diagnostics:</strong> The App stores local preferences and small usage
			counters (for example: number of photos taken) on the device. Logs and debugging information are stored
			locally and are not sent to third-party analytics services by default.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2. What the App collects</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Photos you take:</strong> When you capture photos using the App, the resulting image file is
			written to the photo library, typically inside the "Narda" album the App creates. The App may add simple
			metadata (for example: app/software name) to the image file for convenience.</li>
		<li><strong>Local usage statistics:</strong> The App keeps local counters and timestamps (photos taken, last
			used) to show small-scale usage information in the app UI.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. How the App uses and shares data</h2>

	<p>The App uses camera and photo library access strictly to provide core app features: capture, process, and save
		photos. Images and local statistics remain on your device unless you explicitly share them using the system
		share sheet or export features.</p>

	<p>Narda does not transmit photos or usage statistics to external servers by default and does not include
		third-party analytics SDKs.</p>

	<h2>4. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>

	<p>The codebase does not include third-party analytics or tracking SDKs. The App relies on system frameworks for
		camera and photo library operations. Any communications performed by system services (for example: iCloud
		photo syncing or App Store calls) are governed by Apple's privacy policies.</p>

	<h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>

	<p>Photos saved by Narda are written to your device's photo library. To remove these photos, delete them from the
		Photos app. Local app settings and counters are stored on-device; deleting the app removes most local data.
	</p>

	<h2>6. Your privacy rights</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Access:</strong> Because Narda does not create user accounts or centralize data on servers, your
			photos and settings remain on-device. You can access saved photos via the Photos app.</li>
		<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete photos via the Photos app to remove images saved by Narda. To clear
			local app data, delete the app from your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>7. Security</h2>

	<p>The App stores data locally on your device. Sensitive operations such as in-app purchases are handled by
		platform-managed services.</p>

	<h2>8. Children</h2>

	<p>The App is appropriate for general audiences. Narda does not knowingly target or collect information from
		children under applicable age thresholds.</p>

	<h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or the law. The "Last updated" date indicates when
		this document was last revised.</p>

	<h2>10. App permissions &amp; usage strings (Info.plist)</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Camera: "We use the camera to take photos for half-frame and multi-exposure captures."</li>
		<li>Photo Library: "We save photos to a Narda album in your photo library."</li>
	</ul>
